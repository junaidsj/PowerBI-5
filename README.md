# Excel Practice: Months, Year, and Networking Days Concepts

This project demonstrates my practice and understanding of Excel functions related to:

- **Months**
- **Year**
- **Networking Days**

These concepts were explored as part of my **Microsoft Power BI Analyst** course, where I worked on transforming raw data into meaningful insights using Excel before progressing to Power BI.

## Key Learnings

- Used `MONTH()` and `YEAR()` functions to extract date components.
- Applied `NETWORKDAYS()` to calculate working days between two dates, excluding weekends and holidays.
- Gained hands-on experience preparing time-based data for reporting and analysis.
- Understood how Excel date functions integrate with Power BI for time intelligence calculations.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft Power BI (course context)
